An algorithm is a specific solution to real-world problems, often expressed in mathematical form, closely related to the problem itself. Data structures serve as the carrier and means of implementation for algorithms in programming languages, being more closely related to the programming language.

Similar to cooking, algorithms are recipes, and data structures are like the onions, ginger, and garlic - the seasonings. The recipe instructs the chef on what seasonings to add.
